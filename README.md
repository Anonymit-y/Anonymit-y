# 🎓 BEng Computer Engineer (in Progress) | 💡 IoT/Embedded Systems Engineer | 📊 Data Engineering Contractor 

### Hi there Stranger, this is my personal github account so the majority of my work is private but I hope some of my public repos may be of use!

I am a passionate BEng Computer Engineering student at the **University of Pretoria (UP)**, I prefer real-world application of the theory that I learn and I hope to specialise in the Internet of Things (IoT) and Building Management Systems (BMS) sector.

I have been focusing my learning on the full stack of **IoT solutions**, from designing and integrating the embedded devices to engineering the data pipelines that are used for business analytics.
